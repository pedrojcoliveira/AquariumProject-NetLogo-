# NetLogo Aquarium Simulation

The objective of this project is to acquire knowledge and develop fundamental skills related to modeling and computational simulation of systems with rational agents using the NetLogo tool.

## Project Description

The project aims to create a simulation of an aquarium environment using NetLogo, a multi-agent programmable modeling environment. The simulation will consist of a virtual aquarium where different types of aquatic creatures, such as fish and coral, interact with each other and their environment based on predefined rules and behaviors.

## Key Features

- Agent-Based Modeling: The simulation will be based on the principles of agent-based modeling, where each individual agent (fish, coral, etc.) will have its own set of behaviors and interactions.
- Environmental Interactions: The aquatic creatures will interact with their surroundings, including water currents, temperature, and food availability. These interactions will influence their movement, growth, and survival.
- Reproduction and Growth: The simulation will incorporate mechanisms for reproduction and growth of the aquatic creatures, allowing the population to evolve over time.
- User Interaction: Users will be able to interact with the simulation, such as adding or removing creatures, adjusting environmental parameters, and observing the effects of their actions on the ecosystem.
- Data Visualization: The simulation will provide visual representations of the aquarium ecosystem, allowing users to observe and analyze the behavior and dynamics of the aquatic creatures.

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding the principles of agent-based modeling and simulation.
- Gaining proficiency in using the NetLogo tool for model creation and simulation.
- Exploring the concepts of emergent behavior and self-organization in complex systems.
- Analyzing and interpreting simulation results to gain insights into the dynamics of the aquarium ecosystem.
- Developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills in the context of computational modeling.
